# ChatBot
This chatbot can be used by any **Airline Services** . It has number of features like Ticket confirmation queries, Flight information queries and general queries. For the queries related to the Database I have used SQL database and for general queries I have created an NLP model for giving the answer to the gereral queries of customers.


A chatbot developed in Django Framework. I have used ajax in javascript, html, bootstrap, css, MySQL and python for developing the product.

I have used NLP for generating the replies by analyzing the input from the user. I have used the fax data from AirIndia website to check the similarity of the query of the text posted by the user to the fax queries.
